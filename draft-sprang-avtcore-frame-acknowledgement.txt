Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism for signaling which video frames
   have been received and decoded by a remote peer.  It comprises an
   RTCP feedback message and an RTP header extension used to request
   said feedback.

   One of the main use cases for this data is to implement various forms
   of Long Term Reference (LTR) reference structures.

1.  Introduction

   The most common way for realtime video to be transmitted is to encode
   a pretty much fixed scalability structure, such as those in the W3C
   [SVC] Scalability mode list.

   In such a scenario, the video encoder produces frames "blindly"
   without real knowledge of what state the remote receiver is in.
   Using recovery mechanisms such as retransmission, forward error
   correction and fast-forwarding past skippable frames the receiver is
   assumed to be able to decode the video.  In some cases those methods
   may not be enough, requiring keyframe requests to be sent as a last
   resort.

   On the other hand, if the encoder is able to reason about which
   frames have been received and decoded it can be more proactive.  One
   way is to store frames that are known to be received so that they can
   be later used as guaranteed good references in the case of e.g. large
   loss events, avoiding the need for potentially large retransmissions
   etc.  Collectively this is often referred to as "Long Term Reference"
   structures or LTR for short, although the exact structure may vary.

   In order to achieve this the sender must be able to reason about the
   state of the receiver, necessitating the need for feedback signals.
   In this document a new RTCP message called "Frame Acknowledgement" is
   introduced as a codec agnostic feedback message for this purpose.
   Further, an RTP header extension is introduced that allows the sender
   to actively request feedback on decoding of the associated frame.
   This allows the sender to both request quick feedback on frames that
   are important for latency, and enables resilience against loss of
   feedback packets.

   Note that it is allowed to report a frame as decoded even if the
   decode process is not complete - as long as the receiver guarantees
   that it will attempt to decode the frame.  The rationale for this is
   that we want to reduce the feedback delay as much as possible.
   Should the decoding of a frame that has been acknowledged fail, then
   the receiver MUST request a keyframe to recover, even if the failed
   decoding belongs to a droppable layer.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Applicability

   Frame Acknowledgement can be used for video streams in most
   topologies.  It is also designed to be codec agnostic.

   In terms of [RFC7667], Point-to-Point is the most straightforward
   target as it is easiest to reason about a single receiver.  A Media
   Translator or other systems that include a decoder are similarly easy
   - from the perspective of the sender the middle box is the receiver.

   If a Transport Translator is used for Point-to-Multi-Point, then the
   middlebox must make sure to make valid translations - e.g. by
   acknowledging a frame only if all recipients of that stream have
   acknowledged said frame.

4.  Existing Feedback Formats

   This section provides an overview, for informational purposes, of
   some existing feedback formats that could be seen as alternatives.

   NACK, defined in [RFC4585], provides only requests for packets the
   receiver is interested in having retransmitted.  Absence of feedback
   is a poor signal for acknowledgement, especially since said feedback
   can be lost.

   [RFC8888] and [TWCC] provide per-packet acknowledgement and so are
   more useful.  A mapping from packet(s) to frame needs to happen but
   that is not a big problem.  However, even if a frame is confirmed to
   be received there is no guarantee that it gets decoded.

   Reference Picture Selection Indication (RPSI) is another existing
   message, but it puts the logic of requesting a particular reference
   frame in the receiver - significantly complicating the system
   especially in Point-to-Multi-Point systems.  It is further codec
   specific, and several modern codecs lack a specification - including
   AV1 and H.266.

   Loss Notification [LNTF] was a proposed RTCP message intended to
   solve most of these problems, but it lacks resilience against loss of
   feedback and also cannot handle out-of-order acknowledgements.  The
   latter makes for instance single-SSRC simulcast structures (e.g. SxTx
   modes in [SVC]) impossible.

5.  Requirements

   The messages in this proposal are intended to fulfill the following
   requirements:

   1.  Codec agnostic The protocol should be general enough to work
       across all current and future codecs.

   2.  Payload Invariant The protocol should not depend on data within
       the encoded bitstream payload.  That includes codec specific
       frame identifiers, feedback requests and feedback messages.

   3.  Uses Frame Identifiers Explicit marking of frames, rather than
       using an indirection via packets.

   4.  Order Invariant The format should not make assumptions about the
       required decode order of frames.

   5.  Send-side Controlled The sender explicitly indicates when and for
       which frames feedback should be sent.

   6.  Loss Resilient The sender should be able to detect and recover
       from lost feedback messages.

   7.  Low Delay The latency should be small, with the sender being able
       to tune delay vs rate tradeoff.

   8.  Low Overhead The network overhead in terms of both packet rate
       and bitrate should be minimized.

6.  Frame Acknowledgment

6.1.  Frame identifier selection

   In order to request and receive information about decoded frames, we
   must be able to identify them.  Rather than adding new metadata for
   this purpose alone, we do that by picking the first available option
   from a list of available sources:

   1.  The frame_number from a Dependency Descriptor header extension
       [DD]

   Note: In this draft version, only a single source is allowed.  Future
   versions may add other alternatives.  Cases can be made for anything
   from a new dedicated identification system (similar to [VFTI]) to
   mappings from codec specific payload data.

6.2.  Frame Acknowledgment Request

   A Frame Acknowledgement Request is an RTP header extension indicating
   the oldest frame ID the sender is interested in receiving feedback
   for.  The request MUST be done on the media SSRC of video frames in
   question.  The request implies a status request for all frames
   starting at the given frame ID, up to and including the frame
   contained in the RTP packet the header extension is attached to -
   even if that frame is not yet complete.  If the extension is attached
   to a packet not containing a video frame, the feedback should be up
   to and including the immediately preceding frame ID.

   Note that the Frame ID is a 16 bit counter with rollover, so e.g. a
   request with Frame ID = 65535 attached to a packet containing Frame
   ID = 1 is a request for the three frames {65535, 0, 1}.

   If a new Frame Acknowledgement Request is sent with an incremented
   Frame ID, all status values prior to that Frame ID are considered as
   acknowledged and can be culled by the receiver.  A sender MUST NOT
   request prior to either the last acknowledged Frame ID or start of
   the stream.

6.3.1.1.  Start Frame ID (16 bits)

   The first Frame ID in this feedback.

6.3.1.2.  L (1 bit)

   If the number frames in the feedback vector is < 128, then L = 0.
   Otherwise L = 1.

6.3.1.3.  length (7 bits or 15 bits)

   An unsigned integer denoting how many consecutive frames this message
   contains feedback for.  The last Frame ID is thus Frame ID + length -
   1.

   If L = 0, length is 7 bits, otherwise length is 15 bits.

6.3.1.4.  status (N bit)

   A bit vector of the length specified in the length field above.  For
   each bit position, the Frame ID is incremented by one.

   A value of 0 indicates the frame has not been received and decoded.
   A value of 1 indicates the frame has been received and decoded.

7.  Security Considerations

   The messages in this proposal may expose a small amount of data,
   namely the number of frames that have been sent, and potentially in
   an indirect way which frames the sender sees as important for
   recovery.

   This data should however not pose any significant privacy or security
   risks.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The RTP header extension needs to have a URI identifier assigned by
   IANA.  See [IANAEXT].

   The RTCP message uses PT = 205 (RTPFB, Generic RTP Feedback).  As of
   writing, the next available FMT value is 12.  A dedicated ID needs to
   be assigned by IANA.  See [IANARTCP].
